## This is fakeNEL!

Let's pretend the `main` branch is currently fully functional (as a main branch should be), but we each need to implement our own features. 

## Creating your own fork of the code:

1. First, `fork` the repository over to your personal GitHub. 
2. Then create a `branch` titled with the feature you're implementing. 
3. Implement it in the space below. Then `add` to make sure the file has been added to the repository.
4. `commit` this code to your local machine
5. `push` the updated code to your remote (online) GitHub repository.

## Merging the code with the `main` branch on GitHub

Once your current version is committed, it's time to open a pull request. This can be done on GitHub through your web browser. 

1. Open your forked repository on GitHub, and under "Contribute" open a pull request. 
2. MH + 1 other lab member will discuss and approve your pull request, if appropriate. 
3. They will then attempt to merge your feature into the `main` branch in hopes that it works flawlessly.


## Pretend NEL script (Type your edits down here):

Features: 

1. `Startup` - Starts NEL
2. `ABR` - runs ABR protocol
3. `dpOAE` - runs our dpOAE script
4. `orderPizza` - orders Pizza during a long AN experiment [someone should remove this at some point to make sure its handled properly :)]
5. `Binding` - runs binding protocol
6. `ChinSOS` - calls for help 
7. `STMpilot` - pilot data for R01 using spectro-temporal modulation (STM) stimuli 
8. `SFOAE` - Runs the most beautiful script for important data collection
9. `Shutdown` - Shuts NEL off, saves current state
